# WebDev-Projects
Here is a list of Projects I have done over the summer and break to refine my Web Development skills.
I have been able to work on simple and short projects which use JS, HTML, CSS, and frameworks such as Bootstrap and more!
If you have any more ideas for me to work on or would like to collaborate or chat, feel free to reach out to me!
